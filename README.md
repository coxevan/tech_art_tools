Personal collection of tech art tools for Maya.

I like to create a large variety of tech art tools. This is just my general repository for tools as I make them, feel like adding them.

Current collection features:

EcFaceRig : Automatic facial rigging set up script.
duplicate_on_curve : Creates duplicates of objects along the path of a curve. Great for creating joint chains.
ecSDKMirror : Set Driven Key utility makes mirroring and copying of SDK's easy and fast.
ecRefCreator : Creates reference images from images you select! (PIL required)
ecZeroChannel : Quick and dirty UI for Reseting channel values of objects
faceMirror : Mirrors and merges faces in maya. (Select an arm, extracts faces, duplicates across the specified plane and merges verts)

Feel free to contact me at coxevan90@gmail for more information or assistance! Feel free to debug/change anything as you wish.
