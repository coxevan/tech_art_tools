Hey!

Thanks for downloading my facial set up script for Autodesk Maya!

All you need to do is place the folder EcFaceRig into your maya scripts directory and execute the following code in your Maya script editor!

import EcFaceRig
reload(EcFaceRig)

That's all there is to it! Please contact me on twitter @evanpcox or email at coxevan90@gmail.com about any issues or suggestions! Thanks so much!
